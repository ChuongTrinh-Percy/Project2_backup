i'm sorry to hear that. may i have your order number and email address, please?
thank you. let me check your order. (after a few minutes) i see that your order is below the minimum order value required for free delivery. the minimum order value for free delivery is $50, and your order's value is $35. that's why you were charged a delivery fee.

i understand your concern, sir. however, i'd like to clarify that the discounts offered on our mobile app are exclusive to the app and are not available on any other platform, including our website. we're constantly looking for ways to reward our customers, and this is one of the ways we do it.

okay, thank you for letting me know. have you tried any troubleshooting steps yourself?
no problem. let me guide you through some basic troubleshooting steps that might help resolve the issue. please turn off the microwave oven and unplug it from the power source. then, check if the power cord is connected securely to the back of the oven.
great. now, plug in the oven and turn it on. set the timer for 30 seconds and see if the oven heats up.
i see. in that case, it seems like there might be a problem with the heating element or the thermostat. both of these are covered under the warranty. i will create a ticket for your warranty claim and escalate it to our senior team for further assistance.
you're welcome. please note that it might take up to 48 hours for our senior team to review your claim and get back to you. they might ask for some additional information or troubleshooting steps, so please keep an eye on your email or phone for any updates.

i'm sorry to hear that, may i know your name and order number so i can check the details of your purchase?
thank you, john. i can see that you purchased the vacuum cleaner from us six months ago. our products come with a one-year warranty, so it should still be covered. can you please tell me what kind of issue you're facing with the vacuum cleaner?
i see. that's definitely not normal. let me check the warranty details of your product to see how we can help you. can you please hold for a moment while i check with our technical team?
thank you for holding, john. i've checked with our technical team, and they've suggested some troubleshooting steps that might help resolve the issue. can you please try the following steps and let me know if it works?
first, please make sure that the vacuum cleaner is plugged in and switched on. then, check if the dustbin is full and needs to be emptied. if it's full, please empty it and try using the vacuum cleaner again. if that doesn't work, please check if the filter is clogged or dirty. if it is, please clean or replace the filter and try using the vacuum cleaner again.
if the issue persists, you can send the vacuum cleaner to us for repair or replacement. we'll take care of it as per the warranty terms. you can initiate the process by filling out the product registration form on our website and providing the necessary details. once we receive your request, we'll get in touch with you to arrange for the repair or replacement.
you're welcome, john. i understand your frustration, and i'm sorry for the inconvenience caused. we'll do our best to resolve the issue as soon as possible. is there anything else i can assist you with today?
you're welcome, john. if you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us. have a great day!
